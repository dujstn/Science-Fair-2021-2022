        Canadian solar power on the international stage has continued to be
        under par in comparison to similar countries across the world. In a
        5-year timeframe between 2015 and 2020, the country increased its solar
        capacity from 2.5GW to 3.3GW and dropped in world ranking for installed
        capacity from 14th to 22nd place. <br /><br />Heliios is a web application offered to
        Canadians that aims to simplify the planning process of a solar array
        installation. Heliios provides users access to services currently not
        offered by the majority of similar prospecting tools found online,
        encouraging contribution towards accelerating the growth of the Canadian
        solar power industry.
