# Heliios: A Machine Learning-Based Solar Forecaster

Over the decades since the emergence of solar power, development in Canada has not stayed on par with other similar countries. Our international ranking in total installed solar capacity has even dropped over the recent years.

To help propel development in this industry, Heliios, a machine learning-powered app, was designed to give Canadians a tool to accurately predict how well a solar array would perform anywhere in Canada. Many existing estimators on the internet often only provide quoting services for small-scale installations in places tied to an address – meaning urban locations. However, in Heliios, users can forecast a wider range of array sizes in any location within Canada.

Heliios’ simple forecasting process means it has the potential to be deployed across the world. With predictions accurate enough to match real, collected data, this project aims to encourage Canadians to begin considering the transition to solar power and a clean future.
